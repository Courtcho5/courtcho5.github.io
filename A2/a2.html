// This code will fade on a red LED, green LED, and RGB LED (purple) when the button is pressed

// Sets and initalizes the variable buttonState to 0
int buttonState = 0;
// Sets and initalizes the variable G to 11
int G = 11; 
// Sets and initalizes the variable R to 9 
int R = 9;
// Sets and initalizes the variable multi to 10  
int multi = 10;  

// Use the setup function to initalize the outputs and inputs of the pins
void setup() {
// Sets the pin associated with R (pin 9) as an output pin   
  pinMode(R, OUTPUT);
// Sets the pin associated with G (pin 11) as an output pin  
  pinMode(G, OUTPUT); 
// Sets the pin associated with multi (pin 10) as an output pin 
  pinMode(multi, OUTPUT);   
// Sets the pin 2 as an input pin
  pinMode(2, INPUT); 
}

// Creates a loop
void loop (){
// Reads the state (HIGH or LOW) of pin 2 and stores the value as buttonState 
  buttonState = digitalRead(2);
// Begins an if else statement: will run the code underneath if the state of pin 2 is HIGH/ if the button is pressed
  if (buttonState == HIGH) {

// RED LED
// Begins a for loop: initializes the variable i as 0 then increases the value of i by one until it reaches 255 resulting in a gradual increase of i.
    for(int i = 0; i < 256;i++){
// Takes R or pin 9 and increases the brightness gradually according to i
      analogWrite(R, i);
// Hold that state for 5 miliseconds
      delay(5);
// End of for loop

      analogWrite(multi, i);

      analogWrite(3,i);
// Hold that state for 5 miliseconds
      delay(5);
// End of for loop
    } 
    
// End of if else statement: if the buttonState or pin 2 reads as LOW/ button is not pressed do not turn on any LEDs
  } else {
// Turns off R or pin 9 LED
    digitalWrite(R,LOW);
// Turns off G or pin 11 LED
    digitalWrite(G,LOW);
