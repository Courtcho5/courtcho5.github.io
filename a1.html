      <h2>Resistor Calculation</h2>
      <p>To calculate the resistor value for each LED, I used Ohm's Law. Each LED is 20mA (0.02A), and the Arduino gives 5 volts so:</p>
      <pre>
      Red LED:
      Voltage drop: 1.8
      V = 5V - 1.8V = 3.2V
      I = 20mA = 0.02A
      R = V / I = 3.2V / 0.02A = 160Ω

      Yellow LED:
      Voltage drop: 1.8
      V = 5V - 1.8V = 3.2V
      I = 20mA = 0.02A
      R = V / I = 3.2V / 0.02A = 160Ω

      Blue LED:
      Voltage drop: 3.3V
      V = 5V - 3.3V = 1.7V
      I = 20mA = 0.02A
      R = V / I = 1.7V / 0.02A = 85Ω
      </pre>
      <p>The closest resistor is 250Ω however, I used a 330Ω resistor for each LED in our circuit because using a higher resistor does not negatively affect the performance of the circuit.</p>

      <h2>Firmware for Blink!</h2>
      <pre>
        <code>
          
//Blink

//Turns an LED on for one second, then off for one second, repeatedly.

void setup() {
  // initialize digital pin LED_BUILTIN as an output.
  pinMode(13, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(8, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(4, OUTPUT);
}

// the loop function runs over and over again forever
void loop() {
  // turn the LED connected to pin 13 on (HIGH is the voltage level)
  digitalWrite(13, HIGH); 
  // wait for 100 miliseconds 
  delay(1000);  
  // turn the LED connected to pin 13 off (LOW is the voltage level) 
  digitalWrite(13, LOW);
  // wait for 100 miliseconds
  delay(100);

   // turn the LED connected to pin 8 on (HIGH is the voltage level)
  digitalWrite(8, HIGH); 
  // wait for 1000 miliseconds 
  delay(1000);  
  // turn the LED connected to pin 8 off (LOW is the voltage level) 
  digitalWrite(8, LOW);
  // wait for 100 miliseconds
  delay(100);

   // turn the LED connected to pin 4 on (HIGH is the voltage level)
  digitalWrite(4, HIGH); 
  // wait for 1000 miliseconds 
  delay(1000);  
  // turn the LED connected to pin 4 off (LOW is the voltage level) 
  digitalWrite(4, LOW);
  // wait for 100 miliseconds
  delay(100);

      <h2>Answers to Questions</h2>
      <h3>Q1. Draw a graph where the X axis is time and the Y axis is voltage across the LEDs. Draw a line for each of your 3 LEDs.</h3>
      <img src="A1graph.png" width="500" height="600" />
      <h3>Q2. How many LEDs could you blink independently with your Arduino? How much current would that draw?</h3>
      <p>I would be able to blink 13 LEDs on this Arduino since there is a maximum of 13 pin slots available. Blinking 13 LEDs would draw 260 mA since 13 LEDs x 20 mA each is 260 mA.  </p>
      <h3>Q4. How fast do you need to blink your LEDs until you no longer can tell that they are blinking?</h3>
      <p>I would have to blink the LEDs at less than 1 milisecond on and off to achieve the appearance that the LEDs are not blinking.</p>
