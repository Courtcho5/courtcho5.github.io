    <h2>Circuit Schematic</h2>
      <p>Here is a picture of the schematic used to make the circuit.</p>
      <img src = "A3schematic1.png" width="500" height="400"/>
      <img src = "A3schematic2.png" width="500" height="400"/>
      <p>Note: TinkerCAD did not have a thermistor, a heat sensor was used, please ignore the 3rd leg.</p>
    <h2>Resistor Calculation</h2>
      <p> A 10kΩ resistor was used for the thermistor because the resistor used on a resistance divider should be the same as the resistance of the divider.
        If we want 2.5V (to power the fan at 10KΩ or 26 degrees Celsius)= 5V * R2/(R2 + 10kΩ) </p>
        <pre>
          Solving 2.5V = 5v * R2/(R2 + 10KΩ) is then
          1/2 = R2 /(R2 +10kΩ) 
          2R2 = R2 + 10kΩ
          R2 = 10k So a 10kΩ should be used.
        </pre>
      <p> A 330Ω resistor was used for the fan. If V = I * R and R = V / I and V = 5v - 1.4v (average for NPN) / 0.01 A = 360Ω  </p>
    <h2>Voltage Divider</h2>
      <p>The value read on the thermistor will vary based on the temperature of the room. Since it generally reads in Celsius we will calculate in that unit. At higher temperatures the resistance decreases, allowing more voltage to pass through. 
        Based on the datasheet, we know that at 25 C the resistor emits 10KΩ of resistance. This information is based on BAPI 10k-2 Thermistor Output Table.</p>
        <img src = "A3dividertable.png" width="500" height="400"/>
        <p>At the voltage divider we may read changes in resistance of between 28136Ω and 5697Ω based on the table. As resistance decreases, the voltage increases.  </p>

    <h2>Firmware for InputOutput!</h2>
      <p>Here is the code used for InoutOutput!</p>
      <pre>
        <code> 
//A3 InputOutput!
// This code turns a fan off or on based on the temperature reading.

// Sets pin A0 to be called "tempPin"
int tempPin = A0;
// Sets pin 3 to be called "fanPin"                
int fanPin = 3;  
// Creates an arbitary value to act as T2 in the beta equation. 25 degrees in Celsius                
int T2 = 25; 
// Resistance of the thermistor 10,000 Ohms, will act as R1 in the beta equation                    
int R1 = 10000;                  
// Sets beta of the beta equation to be 3950.0 This value is derived from an average of beta readings at arbitary celsius temps.
float beta = 3950.0;    
// Initalizes tempRead variable        
int tempRead = 0;    
// Initalizes voltage out (vOut) variable as a floating point 
float vOut = 0.0;

// fanPin will be off at resting
  digitalWrite(fanPin, LOW);     
}


// loop to convert readings from thermistor into temperature to turn on the fan to a mapped speed
void loop() {
// Sets tempRead variable as a reading from the tempPin, value is a long string of numbers
  tempRead = analogRead(tempPin);                    
// tempRead is converted to voltage using the resistance divider equation vOut = vIn * (R2 / (R1 + R2)) 1023.0 is derived from the 10 bit max resistance
  vOut = 5.0 * (tempRead / 1023.0);                  
// Now the thermistor resistance can be calculated using voltage divider formula again vOut = vIn * (R2/(R1+R2)) converted to R2 = (vOut * R1) / (vIn - vOut)
  thermResistor = (vOut * R1) / (5.0 - vOut) ;      
  
// Calculate temperature in Kelvin to be converted to Celsius to convert to Fahrenheit
// Beta equation: beta = ln(R1/R2)/((1/T1)+(1/T2)) converted to T2 = 1/(log(R2/R1) * (1/T1))
// T1 also needs to be converted to Kelvin for the equation (add 273.15), then converted back to C to convert to F F = C * (9/5) + 32
  finalTemp = ((1.0 / ((log(thermResistor / R1) / beta) + (1.0 / (T2 + 273.15))) - 273.15) * 9.0 / 5.0) + 32;

    <h2>Additional Questions</h2>  
      <h3>Question 1:In your voltage divider, can the variable resistor be either R1 or R2 or does it need to be one or the other? Justify your answer with example calculations.</h3>    
        <p>In a voltage divider R2 must be the variable resistance. If the equation is Vout = Vin * (R2/(R1 + R2)) we can make some sample calculations to prove this.</p>
        <pre>
          R2 as fixed: R1 varies = 20kΩ and 30kΩ R2 = 10kΩ 
          Vout = 5v * (10kΩ/(20kΩ + 10kΩ)) = 1.66V
          Vout = 5v * (10kΩ/30kΩ + 10kΩ) =  1.25V
           
          R2 as variable: R1 = 10kΩ and R2 = 20kΩ and 30kΩ
          Vout = 5v * (20kΩ/(10kΩ+20kΩ)) = 3.33V
          Vout = 5v * (30k/(10kΩ+30kΩ)) = 3.75V

          As you can see these values are not the same which implies that the variables are not interchangable.
        </pre>
        
      <h3>Question 2: Draw a graph where the x-axis is time and the y-axis is voltage. Plot the voltage at V-measure of your voltage divider of your shared gif.</h3>
        <img src = "A3graph.png" width="500" height="600"/>  
        <pre> 
          The fan on my circuit turns on at 80 degrees Fahenheit which is about 26 degrees Celsius. According to the beta equation and datasheets the base resistance of a thermistor at 25 Celsius is 10k Omhs.
          We can use the resistance divider equation to find the voltage using our known information. Vout = Vin * (Rout/(Rout + Rin)).
          We also have a 10kΩ resistor in the board so that is Vin.
          So Vout = 5v * 10kΩ/(10kΩ + 10KΩ) = 2.5 V
          However, when my fan is not on, the room temperature is below 80 or about 65 degrees Fahenheit or 18 degrees celsius. According to the beta data sheet that is 13K Omhs.
          So Vout = 5v * 10kΩ/(13kΩ + 10kΩ) = 2.17 V. This is the resting state in my GIF.
        </pre>
        <h3>Question 3: AnalogWrite and analogRead are respectively 8-bit and 10-bit values. Imagine you had 10-bit PWM and a 16-bit analog-to-digital converter instead. How would this change your map() code? Explain your answer.</h3>
          <pre> 
            If the analogWrite and analogRead codes were expanded to 10 and 16 then we would see an increase in the rang that can be supported in map. 
            For example: standard would be map((analogRead value), 0, 1023, 0, 255); With 10 bits it would still be 0 to 1023 but with 16 it would be 0 to 65535.
            It can store 2^16 values and 2^10 values. With one less for indexing.
            So our new map function could look like map((analogRead value), 0, 65535, 0, 1023);
