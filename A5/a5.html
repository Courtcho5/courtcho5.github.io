      <p>Here is all the documentation for assignment 5! This circuit will turn on an LED strip to different brightnesses with an unique RFID tag </p>

    <h2>Circuit Schematic</h2>
      <p>Here is a picture of the schematic used in A5</p>

    <h2>Critical Points Calculation</h2>
      <pre>
        Power source to LED Strip: Voltage = 5V from the power supply 
        Into the Transitior: 1.7A into the transistor see below calculation. 
      </pre>
    <h2>The transistor can handle a max current. Justify how much current you are using.</h2>
      <pre>
        Omh's Law: V = I * R 
        Max current of the transistor 80 A according to the datasheet. We are sending 5V through the LED strip via the regulator. 
        The LED strip has resistors built into the circuit as well as white LEDs with a voltage drop of 3.3V 
        For all 3 white LEDS: 3.3V * 3 = 9.9V
        The resistor on one segment of the LED strip says 181Ω so we will use that to find the current of one 3 LED segment
        12V - 9.9V = 2.1V then 2.1V / 181Ω = 0.012A or 12mA
        There are 98 sets of the 3 LED segments in the roll so 0.012A * 98 = 1.17 A for the roll
        This is less than the max current of 80 A.

    <h2>Additional Questions</h2>  
      <h3>Question 1: What is the absolute maximum amount of current between pins 2 and 3?</h3>    
        <p>
          According to the datasheet the continuous drain current is 37.2 A, this is the maximum current when the current is continuous
          However, if the current is happening in pulsed duty cycles then  (10µs Pulse, Duty Cycle = 1%) then the maximum current is 80 A.
        </p>
      <h3>Question 2:  Draw a schematic for a circuit with using at least your arduino, a DC motor, a flyback diode, and capacitors between power and ground. Find parts with datasheets you could use for each of these schematic components.</h3>
