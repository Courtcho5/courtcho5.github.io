    <h2>Circuit Schematic</h2>
      <p>Here is a picture of the schematic used to make the circuit.</p>

      <img src = "A4schematic2.png" width="500" height="400"/>
      <p>Note: TinkerCAD did not have an alligator clip, there should be one connected to the 10 M resistor leg to a metal object.</p>
    <h2>Resistor Calculation</h2>
      <p> A 10M立 resistor was used for the capacitive sensor because I desired a quick sensitivity for my sensor. If I had used a 
        100M立 resistor it may dampen the current too much and result in a delay in response. 
        I used a 330立 resistor was used to limit the LCD power and precent damage.
        A LCD display needs 3.3V to turn on
        According to the Arduino forum a LCD backlight draws 20mA
        To find the resistance we can use Omh's law:
        5V - 3.3V = 1.7V Excess that needs to be absorbed by the resistor
        1.7V = 0.020 A * R 
        R = 85立

    <h2>Additional Questions</h2>  
      <h3>Question 1: Say you are using a servo motor you attach to pin 9. In your loop() you have the following code:
        for (int i=0, i<180, i++){servo.write(i); delay(100);} 
        Draw a graph with the X axis in seconds, for two seconds, and the y-axis the voltage at pin 9 with respect to ground.</h3>

      <h3>Question 2: Your input device is slightly broken, leading it to give us an erroneous reading 1% of the time. How can we address this? Answer in (pseudo)code.</h3>
        <pre> 
        If our input device is slightly broke and giving us an erroneous reading 1% of the time we can fix this by creating a threshold for readings. 
        For example, in my circuit if a serial value is above 400 then the output will execute, if my device was randomly sending one or two
        values above 400 when it is not supposed to we can accomodate to that by increasing the number of times a high value needs to be recorded to 
        initate the output code.
        Pseudocode:
        
        // Initalize the number of continuous readings needed to execute as 3
        serialReading = analogRead(sensorPin);
        threshold = 3;
        serialThreshold = 500;
        displayCount = 0;
        //If the serialReading is higher than 500 add one to the serial count to check against threshold.
        if (serialReading > serialThreshold  ) {
          count++;
        } else {
          count = 0;
        }
        //If the serial count is higher than the threshold (confirming a touch that isn't a fluke) then add to the display/output/run the output
        if (count >= threshold) {
          displayCount++;
          Serial.println(displayCount);
        }

        </pre>
        <h3>Question 3:  Your input device is slightly noisy, leading the measurement to randomly deviate from the true measurement up or down by 10%. How can we address this? Answer in (pseudo)code.</h3>
          <pre> 
          If our input device is deviating from the true measurement by 10% we can fix this by averaging the readings from a large time period.
          This will help smooth the deviations, we can then use the averages in our output calculations.
          Pseudocode: 

          1. Find the sum of the readings 
          serialReadings = analogRead(sensorPin); // analogRead the sensor
          sum = 0; // Initalize the sum value
          averageLimit = 10; // Set the number of counts per round to be 10, will be used as the denominator in average equation
          for (int i = 0; i < averageLimit; i++) {// for each serial reading that is not above the 10th one, add them together
            sum += serialReadings; // Add together the sum of the previous reading to the most recent one 
          }
          2. Find the average
            average = sum / averageLimit; // Average equation
            Serial.println(average); // Print on a new line
