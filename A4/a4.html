    <h2>Circuit Schematic</h2>
      <p>Here is a picture of the schematic used to make the circuit.</p>

      <img src = "A4schematic2.png" width="500" height="400"/>
      <p>Note: TinkerCAD did not have an alligator clip, there should be one connected to the 10 M resistor leg to a metal object.</p>
    <h2>Resistor Calculation</h2>
      <p> A 10kΩ resistor was used for the thermistor because the resistor used on a resistance divider should be the same as the resistance of the divider.
        If we want 2.5V (to power the fan at 10KΩ or 26 degrees Celsius)= 5V * R2/(R2 + 10kΩ) </p>

      <p>Here is a GIF of InputOutput! in action. A hair dryer was used to increase the temperature rapidly, not to turn the fan.</p>

    <h2>Additional Questions</h2>  
      <h3>Question 1:In your voltage divider, can the variable resistor be either R1 or R2 or does it need to be one or the other? Justify your answer with example calculations.</h3>    
        <p>In a voltage divider R2 must be the variable resistance. If the equation is Vout = Vin * (R2/(R1 + R2)) we can make some sample calculations to prove this.</p>
        <pre>
          R2 as fixed: R1 varies = 20kΩ and 30kΩ R2 = 10kΩ 
          Vout = 5v * (10kΩ/(20kΩ + 10kΩ)) = 1.66V
          Vout = 5v * (10kΩ/30kΩ + 10kΩ) =  1.25V
           
          R2 as variable: R1 = 10kΩ and R2 = 20kΩ and 30kΩ
          Vout = 5v * (20kΩ/(10kΩ+20kΩ)) = 3.33V
          Vout = 5v * (30k/(10kΩ+30kΩ)) = 3.75V

          As you can see these values are not the same which implies that the variables are not interchangable.
        </pre>
        
      <h3>Question 2: Draw a graph where the x-axis is time and the y-axis is voltage. Plot the voltage at V-measure of your voltage divider of your shared gif.</h3>
        <img src = "A3graph.png" width="500" height="600"/>  
        <pre> 
          The fan on my circuit turns on at 80 degrees Fahenheit which is about 26 degrees Celsius. According to the beta equation and datasheets the base resistance of a thermistor at 25 Celsius is 10k Omhs.
          We can use the resistance divider equation to find the voltage using our known information. Vout = Vin * (Rout/(Rout + Rin)).
          We also have a 10kΩ resistor in the board so that is Vin.
          So Vout = 5v * 10kΩ/(10kΩ + 10KΩ) = 2.5 V
          However, when my fan is not on, the room temperature is below 80 or about 65 degrees Fahenheit or 18 degrees celsius. According to the beta data sheet that is 13K Omhs.
          So Vout = 5v * 10kΩ/(13kΩ + 10kΩ) = 2.17 V. This is the resting state in my GIF.
        </pre>
        <h3>Question 3: AnalogWrite and analogRead are respectively 8-bit and 10-bit values. Imagine you had 10-bit PWM and a 16-bit analog-to-digital converter instead. How would this change your map() code? Explain your answer.</h3>
          <pre> 
            If the analogWrite and analogRead codes were expanded to 10 and 16 then we would see an increase in the rang that can be supported in map. 
            For example: standard would be map((analogRead value), 0, 1023, 0, 255); With 10 bits it would still be 0 to 1023 but with 16 it would be 0 to 65535.
            It can store 2^16 values and 2^10 values. With one less for indexing.
            So our new map function could look like map((analogRead value), 0, 65535, 0, 1023);
